Hi there, welcome to my personal website! My name is Onur Kele&#351; [o&#712;nur&#805; k&#799;&#688;&#603;&#712;le&#643;]. I am a first-year MA student in the Department of [Linguistics](https://ling.boun.edu.tr) at [Bo&#287;azi&ccedil;i University](http://www.boun.edu.tr), Istanbul, Turkey. I graduated from the Department of [Foreign Language Education](https://fled.boun.edu.tr) in July 2021. My main research interests include sign language linguistics, (atypical) language development, sentential processing, and computational linguistics. I am currently working as an English Instructor at the School of Foreign Languages at [Istanbul 29 Mayis University](https://yadyok.29mayis.edu.tr/en/ihb).

Research
======
I am affiliated with the [Psycholinguistics Research Laboratory](http://denizlab.boun.edu.tr) led by Dr. Nazik Din&ccedil;topal Deniz. In the lab, I am working on a project that examines how individuals on the autism spectrum process sentences and integrate real world knowledge. I am also volunteering for another project that investigates the processing of negative polarity items (NPIs) in Turkish. Previously I worked as undergraduate research assistant in the [Sign Language Lab](https://linguistics.boun.edu.tr/sign-language-lab) located at the [Department of Linguistics](https://linguistics.boun.edu.tr). Under the supervision of Dr. Kadir G&ouml;kg&ouml;z, I led two research projects where I explored the cognitive and linguistic effects of linguistic deprivation on the narrative abilities and verbal fluency of deaf individuals who use [Turkish Sign Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Sign_Language). My other academic interests cover cognitive modeling and computational analyses of natural languages.
